## System Architecture

### Agent Design
Each traffic light agent consists of:
- **State Representation**: 12-dimensional vector including waiting times, queue lengths, speeds, and traffic density

- **Neural Network**: Multi-layer perceptron with attention mechanism for communication processing
- **Memory System**: Experience replay buffer for stable learning

### Communication Protocol
Agents communicate through:
- **Message Types**: Action intentions, state summaries, coordination requests
- **Neighbor Discovery**: Automatic identification of adjacent intersections
- **Information Sharing**: Real-time exchange of traffic conditions and planned actions

### Reward System
The advanced reward function considers:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Waiting Time | -1.0 | Primary objective: minimize vehicle waiting |
| Queue Length | -0.5 | Prevent traffic congestion buildup |
| Throughput | 2.0 | Maximize vehicles processed |
| Coordination | 1.5 | Reward synchronized green waves |
| Fairness | 1.0 | Balanced service across lanes |
| Fuel Efficiency | 0.8 | Environmental considerations |
| Safety | 2.0 | Promote safe traffic conditions |
| Green Efficiency | 0.3 | Optimize signal timing |

The system automatically tracks:
- **Traffic Metrics**: Waiting times, throughput, queue lengths, average speeds
- **Environmental Metrics**: Fuel consumption, CO2 emissions
- **Coordination Metrics**: Communication events, synchronization efficiency
- **Learning Metrics**: Reward evolution, convergence analysis

### Visualization Tools
```python
from enhanced_config import VisualizationUtils

# Generate comprehensive performance plots
fig = VisualizationUtils.plot_multi_agent_performance(logger)

# Create reward component heatmap
fig = VisualizationUtils.plot_reward_heatmap(logger)

# Visualize communication network
fig = VisualizationUtils.plot_communication_network(comm_logs)
```

# Single-objective optimization (minimize waiting time)
python hyperparameter_optimization.py --trials 100

# Multi-objective optimization (waiting time, throughput, fuel)
python hyperparameter_optimization.py --multi-objective --trials 50

# Compare optimization strategies
python hyperparameter_optimization.py --strategy-comparison

# Sensitivity analysis
python hyperparameter_optimization.py --sensitivity-analysis
```

### Custom Optimization
```python
from hyperparameter_optimization import OptimizationStudy

study = OptimizationStudy("my_optimization")
study.run_optimization(n_trials=100)
study.save_best_config("optimized_config.json")
```

### Compare Multiple Models
```python
from enhanced_config import ModelComparison

model_configs = {
    'baseline': 'baseline_model',
    'enhanced': 'enhanced_model',
    'optimized': 'optimized_model'
